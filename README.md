# MIT_6828_LAB_Solutions


This project records my hard but interesting procedues in studing the famous series of MIT 6.828 courses.

The issues text will be writed in English.

The reason why I inisist in using English can be divided into two parts: 
On the one hand, nearly all of the scripts, lecutre materials, books of the course/project I am studing
is English-version. On the other hand, a poor translation may lead us far away from the origin ideas the 
writer wanna show to the readers.

Anyway, the chat is cheap.

Let's work!
